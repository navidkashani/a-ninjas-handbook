# Chapter 3

In 2012, the FBI nabbed a hacker known as w0rmer. He'd hacked several U.S. law enforcement websites and leaked their data online. You might think it took a big, complicated operation to catch him, but nope! w0rmer just had terrible operational security (opsec). He gave away his exact location to the FBI by replacing their database with a picture of his girlfriend from the neck down in a bikini, holding a sign that said "PwNd by w0rmer & CabinCr3w, <3 u BiTch's!" It's not like they identified the girl from the picture; w0rmer forgot (or didn't care) to erase the GPS coordinates from the picture's metadata. The FBI saw the coordinates were from an iPhone 4 in an outer Melbourne suburb. w0rmer overshared his location through a picture.

Having electrical tape on your webcam and using Tor browser inside Whonix OS won't save you if you share too much about yourself over time. Having good opsec often means being in control and aware of what you're sharing when talking to people or posting online.

## Identify the sensetive data and information

The first step to improving our OPSEC is identifying the data that's sensitive to us. To do that, we need to check our threat model. We figure out what threats are common and which data would cause the most trouble if it fell into the wrong hands. Then, we prioritize the information based on how severe the consequences would be.

With this plan, we can cut down on unnecessary caution. Being overly cautious about everything we say or share can drain a lot of mental energy and increase the chances of slipping up. But if we focus on what's sensitive based on our own unique situation and threat model, we can reduce the mental energy needed to maintain our OPSEC.
