# Chapter 4

Continuing with the Minecraft analogy from Chapter 2, imagine you're still in the game. You've become quite familiar with it now—you've even got your locations written down, and you've gathered some wood and set up a crafting table. With these resources, you can start crafting essential tools like wooden axes, shovels, swords, a bed, and a shelter to survive the night. You're ready to take on mobs, gather rocks and stones, and explore your surroundings.

As you become more skilled, you'll progress to stone tools, then iron, and maybe even diamond if you're up for the challenge. Just like in the game, reaching the diamond level requires embarking on deep adventures into scary caves, requiring time and dedication.

But this chapter focuses on the essentials—the wooden and stone tools—of the privacy world. These are the basic building blocks of your digital privacy and security. The essentials in the privacy world include encryption tools, anonymity tools, VPNs, emails, secure messengers, password managers, and multi-factor authentication tools. These are the bare minimums for privacy, aligning with the threat models of most individuals.
