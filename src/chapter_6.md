# Chapter 6

Everything you touch leaves your fingerprint on it, and everywhere you go, you leave your footprints behind, making you identifiable and your actions traceable back to you. Unless you're wearing gloves, are cautious of not leaving your DNA behind, and wipe your footprints as you go forward, the same goes for you when you use the internet.

On the internet, we all have unique fingerprints and leave footprints behind as we use it. The more you use it, the more unique your fingerprints become and the clearer your footprints become.

This chapter is all about making yourself as less unique as possible and covering your footprints as much as possible. It might be impossible to fully wipe your old footprints because anything you put out there on the internet can stay there forever, and it's impossible to not have a fingerprint at all. The key is to create multiple unique fingerprints and keep them separated from each other. This strategy will save you a lot of energy, time, and anxiety, and make it sustainable for the long run.
