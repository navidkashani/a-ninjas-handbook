# Chapter 6

Everything you touch leaves your fingerprint on it, and everywhere you go, you leave your footprints behind, making you identifiable and your actions traceable back to you. Unless you're wearing gloves, are cautious of not leaving your DNA behind, and wipe your footprints as you go forward, the same goes for you when you use the internet.

On the internet, we all have unique fingerprints and leave footprints behind as we use it. The more you use it, the more unique your fingerprints become and the clearer your footprints become.

This chapter is all about making yourself as less unique as possible and covering your footprints as much as possible. It might be impossible to fully wipe your old footprints because anything you put out there on the internet can stay there forever, and it's impossible to not have a fingerprint at all. The key is to create multiple unique fingerprints and keep them separated from each other. This strategy will save you a lot of energy, time, and anxiety, and make it sustainable for the long run.

## Separating Fingerprints

We all have real identities in the real world, and we have to use the internet with our real identity too. We can't stop using credit cards and banks and buy everything on Tor using Monero. That is simply not possible. But we can separate our real identity fully, giving it its unique fingerprint, unique behavior, and unique writing style, and for our other identities, we can separate them as well.

For example, an activist who wants to remain anonymous can still have two unique fingerprints: one for their real identity and one for their activist identity. The uniqueness of the fingerprint is never the problem in such scenarios as long as you keep these fingerprints separated. If you use your activist fingerprint to do your real-world stuff, then it's a problem. Now you've cross-contaminated the identities. But if you don't, it won't be a problem. Even if they start tracking your activist identity, it won't lead them to your real identity. It has its own footprint, which traces nowhere near your real identity, and it has its own unique behavior, unique writing style, etc.

However, sometimes you truly need to look like others, such as when someone buys stolen data off the dark web (not that I encourage illegal activities as such). Then it will be best to look like everyone else on that website. Again, it all depends on your threat model.

How can you separate your fingerprints? Here are some tips, but you should take a look at your threat model and build a strategy based on that.

- **Create separate working environments**: It can be having multiple different accounts on your computer, phone, etc., or having fully separated virtual machines set up for each different identity.
- **Create separate accounts**: Have different emails, cloud storages, VPN accounts, etc., for each identity.
- **Create separate backstories**: Have different identities, and give them separate lives and backstories. This will make it easier to keep up with them.
- **Create separate behavior patterns**: Your typing style (speed, accuracy, etc.), writing style, expressions and words you use, the way you respond, your clicking and mouse movement patterns, the websites you usually visitâ€”these are all behavior patterns that can cross-contaminate identities.
- **Use fingerprint-resistant tools**: Use tools like Tor Browser, a hardened Firefox, Whonix OS, etc.

There are analysis algorithms to match these unique behaviors to other users and accurately pinpoint the user who has the same behaviors and fingerprint. Even if such algorithms are not used by authorities, they exist, and they can be used. So they might and will be used, just like how they're used nowadays for marketing and advertisement purposes. Most of the time, privacy is about preventing such things from happening.
