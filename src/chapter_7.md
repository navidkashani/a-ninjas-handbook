# Chapter 7

In the early 2000s, a whistleblower known only as "Deep Throat" played a crucial role in exposing the Watergate scandal, which eventually led to the resignation of U.S. President Richard Nixon. Deep Throat was later revealed to be Mark Felt, a top official at the FBI.

Felt chose to remain anonymous because he feared retribution from powerful political figures and potential harm to his career and personal life. By meeting secretly with journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, Felt provided critical information that helped uncover illegal activities and abuses of power within the Nixon administration.

His anonymity allowed him to share the truth without facing immediate consequences, ultimately leading to significant political changes and reinforcing the importance of accountability in government. Mark Felt's story shows how anonymity can allow people to bring positive change to the world, rather than doing destruction to society. It's a double-edged sword as well as a slippery slope.

Taking away people's anonymity means silencing dissenting voices and creating an environment of fear in which society halts. When individuals can't speak out without risking their safety, privacy, or lives, we lose dissenting opinions, and the creativity of a society dies out. It will start moving backwards, and fear will slowly become the norm of society, passing from one generation to the next, slowly taking away what makes us different from other animals.

## Creating Another Identity

As I mentioned in previous chapters, creating a full identity can really help in managing identities and keeping them as separate as possible. Based on your threat model and what you're going to do, you might need to create a pseudonym for yourself and tie it to your anonymous activities.

There's a difference between pseudonymity and anonymity. Pseudonymity means giving your anonymous identity a name, so people can recognize you and your work, for example, a writer using a pen name. Anonymity means hiding one's identity entirely so that there is no way to trace or identify the individual behind the actions or information.

You can still be anonymous and have a pseudonym. Rather than being nameless, especially if you're an activist, writer, or whistleblower, you might need a pseudonym or a fake identity that people would recognize your work with. People can connect better with someone who has a name and identity, even if it's not real, rather than a nameless user on the internet.

Pseudonymous users can build a reputation and credibility over time, while anonymous users cannot build a reputation tied to a specific identity.

To create your pseudonymous identity, you can choose one of these paths:

- Create a username/nickname only
- Create a full identity
- Create a combination of both

### Creating a Username/Nickname Only

This path is easier; you only have to think of a unique and untraceable nickname or username and tie your activities to that. The drawback is that it can make it harder to gain reputation and credibility, and if you work with other people, you might want to have an actual name and origin as well.

A real-life example of a nickname would be the famous "Dread Pirate Roberts," aka "DPR," which was the nickname of Ross Ulbricht, the creator of the "Amazon of Drugs," aka the Silk Road. Ross Ulbricht had no other name than this, just one name, "Dread Pirate Roberts."

What matters when creating a nickname is that you don't choose something that can be linked to your real identity. That is the only and most important thing when it comes to creating nicknames. Make sure it doesn't reflect too much of your real identity's interests, and make sure you have never used it before.

To prevent links between your real identity and your nickname, it's better to use a nickname generator website. Search for one and choose one that sounds the best to you, and check its uniqueness as well. Google it and see if anyone else has it or not.

### Creating a Full Identity

This path involves choosing a country, an origin story, birthday, full name, gender, address, email with that name, etc. Basically, you are creating yourself a full character with its own interests, style of writing, name, birthplace, birthdayâ€”everything.

The advantage of this path is that it is really easy to keep it separate from your real identity. If you have to sign up somewhere that requires information, you can enter the fake personal information you created before.

Make sure the name doesn't lead back to you and write it down in a safe place to keep it consistent, so you don't have to change anything if you forget it.

Also, there are a lot of websites that can generate random and fake identities and addresses. Just search for one and you'll find a ton of them.

### Create a Combination of Both

This path, in my opinion, is the most convenient. You can have both a nickname and a full identity and use them as needed. For example, for your GitHub, you can use your nickname as the username and the fake name as your name.

This can bring you both reputation and credibility and ease of identity management, while allowing you to use either name based on the situation.

Just make sure the nickname and identity don't lead back to your real identity. You can also create some nicknames by combining the name and information of your fake identity as well.
