# Chapter 7

In the early 2000s, a whistleblower known only as "Deep Throat" played a crucial role in exposing the Watergate scandal, which eventually led to the resignation of U.S. President Richard Nixon. Deep Throat was later revealed to be Mark Felt, a top official at the FBI.

Felt chose to remain anonymous because he feared retribution from powerful political figures and potential harm to his career and personal life. By meeting secretly with journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, Felt provided critical information that helped uncover illegal activities and abuses of power within the Nixon administration.

His anonymity allowed him to share the truth without facing immediate consequences, ultimately leading to significant political changes and reinforcing the importance of accountability in government. Mark Felt's story shows how anonymity can allow people to bring positive change to the world, rather than doing destruction to society. It's a double-edged sword as well as a slippery slope.

Taking away people's anonymity means silencing dissenting voices and creating an environment of fear in which society halts. When individuals can't speak out without risking their safety, privacy, or lives, we lose dissenting opinions, and the creativity of a society dies out. It will start moving backwards, and fear will slowly become the norm of society, passing from one generation to the next, slowly taking away what makes us different from other animals.
