This book is free and open source and will stay free and open source because what's important to me is that it is read and comes in useful. Iâ€™m not looking for profit, but I can't deny that every donation, no matter the amount, or even an appreciation email, allows me to put more time into projects like this.

So here are every cryptocurrency I could think of. If you would like to donate, here are the ways to do so:
